# facerecogintion
Voting machines huh many people believe in present voting systems based on EVM's but some people are opposing this system for reasons such as rigging of votes,evm's hacking.Hence we came with the idea having a voting machine which is way more secured than the present working evm's.
This project is based on fingerprint and face recognition voting machine. Face recognition is done using transfer learning technique of Deep Learning. The transfer learning that we used is VGG16. Fingerprint scanner will be attached with ARM controller to identify the fingerprint of a particular person.
If both face and fingerprint analyzed is said to be the face and fingerprint of that particular person then only he /she will be allowed to vote. Else no voting for fake ones.
